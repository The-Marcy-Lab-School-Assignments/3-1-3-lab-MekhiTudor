# Question

What is the primary difference between an HTTP GET request and an HTTP Post request?

# Answer
The GET request just pulls the response from the given URL after the request is sent. With the POST request you are sending information to be added to the data.

Yup! The GET request asks the server for information and then receives it, and the POST request adds more data to the server!
